When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

Remote repositories allow multiple users to work on a project, and can also be used to share the project publicly. It also provides an off site back up, and provides a central storage location if you work from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Many updates require multiple commits to add features. It would be better to push these together when the change is complete, so the Github version doesn't hold incomplete versions.
