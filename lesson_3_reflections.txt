When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 

Remote repositories allow multiple users to work on a project, and can also be used to share the project publicly. It also provides an off site back up, and provides a central storage location if you work from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Many updates require multiple commits to add features. It would be better to push these together when the change is complete, so the Github version doesn't hold incomplete versions.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is Githubs mechanism for cloning a repository on it's own servers. It's used to clone a repository while giving credit to the original repository.

Clones are copies of repositories, and are best used locally.

Branches are used to develop different versions of a project, or to allow changes to be made without breaking the master branch. Changes can then be mergerd into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You may have to work without internet access, and would still be able to refer to the most recent build.
