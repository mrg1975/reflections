What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a hidden directory .git, which contains the data for the file history of the commits.
Before doing this git does not track any changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contians all the files that can be worked on, but the staging area only contains the files we choose to add to the commit.
The staging area allows us to coose which files are going to be added to a commit.
